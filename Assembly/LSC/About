 Although an assembly module can't contain external references, and so cannot make C function calls, it can make Linux system calls. This example uses Linux system call #1 (write) to output a message.
 Note that references to locations within the module must be program counter relative.

 Load the code with:

     include Assembly/LSC/cool.xfs
