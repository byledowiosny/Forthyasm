 The ptrace interface is a framework for debugging from Forthx64. While it could be used to debug any process, it is most conveniently suited for debugging Forthx64 itself, since addresses in the tracee will be the same as those in the tracer. For debugging other processes, addresses can be obtained from the dwarf2 listing file produced by the assembler command line options, "-g dwarf2 -l <filenam>.lst" for yasm or "-g -a ><filename>.lst" for as.
 The framework includes all the major features of the ptrace system call. Tracee memory can be examined, registers displayed, breakpoints set, execution single-stepped, etc.
 To allow ptrace without root privileges, edit /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and change the line:

    kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1

To read

    kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0
